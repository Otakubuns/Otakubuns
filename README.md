### Welcome to My Coding Garden! ðŸŒ¹âœ¨
Hey! I'm Alexus, an aspiring software developer with an interest in web development. ðŸ’•

Most of my public projects are game mods with a sprinkle of other cool stuff.<br>
I love adding things I want to games or making something useful.

You'll find some stuff below in my pinned reposâ€”have a look around! More stuff will pop up here as I continue my coding journey! ðŸŒŸ
